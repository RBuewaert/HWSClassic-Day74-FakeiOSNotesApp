"Have you ever heard the phrase, “imitation is the highest form of flattery”? I can’t think of anywhere it’s more true than on iOS:
Apple sets an extremely high standard for apps, and encourages us all to follow suit by releasing a vast collection of powerful, flexible APIs to work with.

Your challenge for this milestone is to use those API to imitate Apple as closely as you can: I’d like you to recreate the iOS Notes app.
I suggest you follow the iPhone version, because it’s fairly simple: a navigation controller, a table view controller,
and a detail view controller with a full-screen text view."
